Java						JavaScript
-------------					--------------
It is a non-scripting language.			It is a scripting language.
						(We won't compile the program)

We can run individually.			We can't run individually.

execution.

It is a object oriented programming language.	It is a object based programming language.

It is a strongly typed checking language.	It is a loosely typed language.

It is a complex language.			It is easy language compare to java.


JavaScript History
==================
Original name of JavaScript is LiveScript.

LiveScript was developed in the year of 1990's.

In 1995, Brenden Eich popular scientist of Netscape Corporation renamed LiveScript to JavaScript.

JavaScript consider as weakly typed checking language.

The official name of JavaScript is ECMA Script.

ECMA means Europeon Computer Manufacturing Association.


Advantages of JavaScript
==========================
1) It is used to develop interactive web pages.

2) It is used to perform client side form validation.

3) It is used to display dialog boxes and popup boxes.

4) It supports drag and drop menu.

5) It supports objects like Date,Array,String,RegEx and etc.

6) It supports cookies.

7) It is used to add dynamic content in a web page.

and etc.


Javascript program
------------------
	<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
		stmt1;
		stmt2;
		stmt3;
	</script>
	
	Here type and language attributes are optional to declare.
	In javascript, semicolon is not mandatory because it is a loosely typed checking language.
	
ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
			
			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class");

		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			
			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class")

		</script>
</body>
</html>

If we need space at the end of the statement then we need to use document.writeln().

ex:
--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			
			document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript")
			document.writeln('This is IHUB Talent')

		</script>
</body>
</html>

In order to get a new line we need to use <br> tag.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			
			document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript")
			document.writeln("<br>")
			document.writeln('This is IHUB Talent')

		</script>
</body>
</html>

We can write HTML and CSS styles in a javascript code.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			
			document.writeln("<h1 style='color:blue'>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>")
			document.writeln("<br>")
			document.writeln("<p style='text-align:center;background-color:cyan;'>This is IHUB Talent</p>")

		</script>
</body>
</html>

If any document contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript is called DHTML (Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language).


JavaScript Engine
==================
JavaScript engine allows javascript code to execute on a browser window.

It converts user understandable scripting language to machine understable scripting language.

Every browser contains javascript engine as given below.

Ex:
		Browser			JavaScript Engine
		--------		----------------
		Chrome 			V8 Engine 
		Mozilla			SpiderMonkey
		Edge			Chakra
		and etc.	
		


Comments in JavaScript
=======================
Comments are create for documentation purpose.

Comments improve readability of javascript code.

JavaScript engine does not display javascript comments in output.

We have two types of comments in javascript.

1) Single line comment
--------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		//

2) Multiple line comment
--------------------
	It is more convenient when compare to single line comment because we can comment a single 
	line and multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			-
			-
		*/

Types of output statement in JavaScript
========================================
We have two types of output statements in javascript.

1) document.writeln()

2) console.log() 

1) document.writeln()
---------------------
It is used to display the output on browser window.
ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			
			document.writeln("<h1>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>");

		</script>
</body>
</html>

2) console.log() 
-----------------
It is used to display the output on browser console.
In order to see the browser console we need enable developer option.
To see the developer option we need to press F12 Function key.
ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			
			console.log("Welcome to JavaScript");

		</script>
</body>
</html>

Types of variables in javascript
=================================
A name which is given to a memory location is called variable.

Purpose of variable is used to store the data.

In javascript , a variable is also known as identifier.

We have same rules for javascript variables as we have for identifiers.

Rule1:
--------
A javascript variable must and should starts with alphabet,underscore or dollar symbol.
ex:
	_=10;
	$=20;
	abcd=30;

Rule2:
-----
After first alphabet it can have any number of digits.
ex:
	a1234;  //valid 


Rule3:
-----
Every identifier is a case sensitive.
ex:
	a=10;
	A=10;

In javascript variables are divided into two types.

1)Local variable

2)Global variable 

1)Local variable
----------------
If we declare any variable inside a block or a function is called local variable.

We can access local variable within the block or function only.

ex:1
-----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			function f1()
			{
				var i=10;
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:2
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			function f1()
			{
				var i=10;
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

2)Global variable 
----------------
If we declare any variable outside a block or a function is called global variable.

We can access global variable within the block or function or outside of the block or function.


ex:1
------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			var i=100;
			
			function f1()
			{
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			
			//call the function
			f1();
			
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:2
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			var i=100;

			function f1()
			{
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i);
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>
